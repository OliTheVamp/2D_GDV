So there was a rumor I remember in school about you and what had happened,|n
I'm surprised you remember that far back.|n
Yeah, yeah. I heard someone had found a knife and tossed it down into the valley to hide evidence.|n
A knife? I've seen one, but it wasn't tossed down into the valley.|n
Good. Imagine if it had impaled a squirrel or something—|n
I saw a blade of a knife out beside a tree that had recently been cut down. Some kids had used it to carve their initials into the trunk.|n
Those pesky teens. Why tag trees when you can tag buildings! Save the trees!|n
I mean, the tree had already been cut down. I don't think there was much to be saved,|n
Hey, you're really ruining my argument here… Save trees not houses!|n
Was that supposed to be a rhyme?|n
Tag homes not the fauna and fomes!|n
Sometimes I get sad that I'm dead, but you just helped me to appreciate it.|n
