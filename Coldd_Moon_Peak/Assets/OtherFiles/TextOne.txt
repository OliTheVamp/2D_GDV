I mean, it's totally possible some other ghostly apparition appears here every so often to scare all the college kids away.|n
I mean it's not impossible…|n
Must be boring being out here for so long,|n
It's lonely sometimes, but at least I have a good view of the moon.|n
Well done. I don't think you could have said anything more depressing, |n
Thanks,|n
(that wasn't a compliment)|n
How did you do that?! The sheet?” (That's so rad, that's so metal)|n
I dunno’ I kinda’ just wanted it…|n
Can you like… Want a million dollars?|n
I don't think it works like that,|n
Oh… I guess it would be like… Ghost currencey always.|n
I don't think we have ghost currencey…|n
So you have sheets but not money… Man, must be good.|n
