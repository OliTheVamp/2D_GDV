Sorry to bother you again, |n
You're not really a bother compared to the teens who come out here to suck face,|n
Sucking face? You mean snogging, necking, canoodling?! The age long ceremony of the swapping of spit?!!|n
If only it was possible to die a second time. Anyway, I used to run track and field and this conversation has me itching for another run.|n
I guess this time you weren't fast enough, huh?|n 
What?|n
You know what, never mind. I think you still hold the school record for the two hundred meter race.|n
Shoes are the most important thing for an athlete, I saw a shoe that looked similar to mine out underneath the evergreen.|n
Why can't normal trees get cool names like evergreen, like, imagine this: leaves only sometimes.|n
That sounds terrible.|n
And then when it's winter its: sticks other times.|n 
I think you should go now,|n
