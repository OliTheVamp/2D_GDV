So I’ve been thinking—|n
That must have been difficult for you.|n
Very funny, so as I was saying|n

There was a house key that a squirrel was gnawing on, must have been hungry from the winter.|n
Okay… little guy might need a tetanus shot after that|n
I think it had made a nest in one of the old tents pitched up out here|n
Waterproof, windproof, cosy. Couldn't think of a better place to make a nest. I bet all the other squirrels are jealous|n
I don't have to worry about wind or rain, it passes right through me.|n
Aw man, who would have imagined the most tragic thing about dying is that you can't splash in puddles|n
I can't really do a lot of things anymore|n
