So I’ve been thinking—|n
That must have been difficult for you.|n
As I was saying, I remember seeing a lot of your stuff at the oop store. You had a really terrible taste in music and a terrible taste in fashion, feels like a waste with a face like yours.|n
… Thank you?|n
You're welcome. But yeah, I heard that there was a lot of stuff left here when the incident happened. I mean who even litters these days? Absolute betas.|n
There was a house key that a squirrel was gnawing on, must have been hungry from the winter.|n
Okay… little guy might need a tetanus shot after that, can squirrels even get tetanus?|n
I think it had made a nest in one of the old tents pitched up out here.|n
Waterproof, windproof, cosy. Couldn't think of a better place to make a nest. I bet all the other squirrels are jealous.|n
I don't have to worry about wind or rain, it passes right through me.|n
Aw man, who would have imagined the most tragic thing about dying is that you can't splash in puddles|n
I can't really do a lot of things anymore, but the squirrels are fun to watch, and they don't run away from me.|n
